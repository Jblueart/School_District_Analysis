### School district Investigation

School district opened an investigation to look at several key metrics by with a district wide comparisan of the different schools. Primary analysis focused on math and reading scores. Once the board reviewed the data, concerns were raised about Thomas High School's 9th grade class. 

#### Original Per School Math

#### Original Per School Reading

School board asked for the data to be removed & reanalyzed to rule out any conflicts

#### Thomas Highschool Removed

10% reduction in math scores when the offending students were removed from the study. The reading scores didn't face as much of a difference. 

 
#### Scores by school spending

I was suprised that the schools spending the least had the highest scores in general. 

#### Passing scores by spending per student

#### Scores by school size

The largest schools had the fewest students in the overall passing category. 
Smaller schools show a correlation with higher percentages of student success in both reading and math. 

#### Scores by school type

Charterschools out performed district schools. 

#### Conclusions

Ultimatly the  study shows that bigger isn't always better, student class size had a large influence on success rates. If a larger school lets students slip through the cracks and fall behind they may not be as successful in life.
